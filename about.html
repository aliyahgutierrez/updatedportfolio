                                        Did you hear that? They've shut down the main reactor. We'll be destroyed for
                                        sure. This is madness! We're doomed! There'll be no escape for the Princess this
                                        time. What's that? Artoo! Artoo-Detoo, where are you? At last! Where have you
                                        been? They're heading in this direction.

                                        What mission? What are you talking about? I've had just about enough of you! Go
                                        that way! You'll be malfunctioning within a day, you nearsighted scrap pile! And
                                        don't let me catch you following me begging for help, because you won't get it.
                                        No more adventures. I'm not going that way. That malfunctioning little twerp.

                                        Whatever you say. I've done more that I bargained for on this trip already. Be
                                        patient, Luke. Stay and watch over the droids. But he can. They must be
                                        delivered safely or other star systems will suffer the same fate as Alderaan.
                                        Your destiny lies along a different path than mine.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        There she is. See-Threepio, do you copy? For the moment. Uh, we're in the main
                                        hangar across from the ship. We're right above you. Stand by. You came in that
                                        thing? You're braver that I thought. Nice! Come on! It's them! Blast them! Get
                                        back to the ship! Where are you going? Come back! He certainly has courage.

                                        The old man wants us to wait right here. But he didn't know she was here. Look,
                                        will you just find a way back into the detention block? I'm not going anywhere.
                                        They're going to execute her. Look, a few minutes ago you said you didn't want
                                        to just wait here to be captured.

                                        Marching into the detention area is not what I had in mind. But they're going to
                                        kill her! Better her than me. She's rich. Rich? Yes. Rich, powerful! Listen, if
                                        you were to rescue her, the reward would be.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Besides, they let us go. It's the only explanation for the ease of our escape.
                                        Easy...you call that easy? Their tracking us! Not this ship, sister. At least
                                        the information in Artoo is still intact.

                                        We're going in. We're going in full throttle. Right with you, boss. Luke, at
                                        that speed will you be able to pull out in time? It'll be just like Beggar's
                                        Canyon back home. We'll stay back far enough to cover you. My scope shows the
                                        tower, but I can't see the exhaust port! Are you sure the computer can hit it?
                                        Watch yourself! Increase speed full throttle! What about the tower? You worry
                                        about those fighters! I'll worry about the tower! Artoo...that, that
                                        stabilizer's broken loose again! See if you can't lock it down! I'm hit! I can't
                                        stay with you.

                                        We've entered the Alderaan system. Governor Tarkin, I should have expected to
                                        find you holding Vader's leash. I recognized your foul stench when I was brought
                                        on board. Charming to the last.

                                        Yes, I'll bet you have. Sorry about the mess. Her resistance to the mind probe
                                        is considerable. It will be some time before we can extract any information from
                                        her. The final check-out is complete. All systems are operational.
                                    </p>
